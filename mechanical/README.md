## 3DOF Head Mechanical Design

This folder contains the custom-designed 3DOF head mechanism used in the intelligent home assistant robot.

Degrees of Freedom:
- Yaw (left / right)
- Pitch (up / down)
- Roll (tilt)

Design notes:
- Designed for MG90S micro servos
- Optimized for 3D printing (PLA)
- Separate yaw, pitch, and roll axes
- Intended for expressive motion, not load-bearing use

Files:
- STL: 3D printing
- STEP: design reference / modification
