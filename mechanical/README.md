## 3DOF Head Mechanical Design

This directory contains the mechanical design files for a 3DOF servo-driven head
used in the early development phase of the interactive home assistant robot.

Degrees of Freedom:
- Yaw (left / right)
- Pitch (up / down)
- Roll (tilt)

Design notes:
- Designed for MG90S micro servos
- Optimized for 3D printing (PLA)
- Intended for expressive motion, not load-bearing use

## File Structure
- Assembly files are located in this directory
- Render images are located in the `renders/` folder
